Hi there! My name is Kelly Huang and I am a senior majoring in Statistics. This is my last semester at BU and I am very excited to be working with this group on one of my final undergraduate projects. 

At the moment, I am unsure what data I want to study for this project. There are many things that interest me and there is likely very much data on a broad range of topics that would be suitable for this project. One possible area of focus could be environmental data. My recent trip to Acadia National Park let me explore and learn about the habitat there and led me to wonder what data Acadia and other national parks have collected. Many questions could be asked and possibly answered through analysis of this data (How has the environment changed? What is the effect of visitors on the habitat? Etc.). 

There are still many other interesting topics we can look into. I am looking forward exploring these possibilities, and then analyzing and learning with my teammates through this project.
