<p>For the boston airbnb dataset, Iâ€™m performing a relationship between accommodates number and airbnb price. Here are the preliminary analysis of airbnb price:</p>

<p>After boxploting all data by grouping accommodates number from 0 - 16, there is an approximately positive relationship between accommodates number and price as the accommodates number increase the price increase too. However, there are two odds data as the accommodates nunmber = 9 or 16, those two data are lower than $250 per day, which usually are the price for 3-5 people. Overall, it is possible to conclude that there is a pattern of price depending on the accommodates number.</p>
