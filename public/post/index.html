        EDA - Listing Descriptions

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I wanted to begin our investigation of the textual data included in our dataset. One important aspect of an AirBnB listing is the description. For this EDA, I decided to explore how the length of a description is related to how popular a listing may be with guests. Two variables that are related to this are Number of Reviews, which implies the number of people who have stayed at this listing, and Availability, which will indicate how many days the are open for the listing, with less availability suggesting more bookings.

        How is accommondate number asssociate with airbnb price in Boston?

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      For the boston airbnb dataset, I’m performing a relationship between accommodates number and airbnb price. Here are the preliminary analysis of airbnb price:
After boxploting all data by grouping accommodates number from 0 - 16, there is an approximately positive relationship between accommodates number and price as the accommodates number increase the price increase too. However, there are two odds data as the accommodates nunmber = 9 or 16, those two data are lower than $250 per day, which usually are the price for 3-5 people.

From the graph, I conclue that there is no relationship between cleaing fee and price. The point is scattered in the plot. Thus, I consider to remove this variable or to make some transformation. I will also try to find which variables are correlated with the cleaning fee.

      load the data in R: We will download the related csv files and load them into our final project directory. Look for any unusual values or codings in the data: Many variables in the dataset are urls for the listing, pictures, or host. We do not believe this will be useful in our analysis so these were removed. Other variables had some unusual values that we needed to check. For example, there were many formattings and spelling issues in the strings for the variable “city” and “smart_location”.

      At the beginning, we have several different preferences about the final project. Someone would like to detect the environment related data, and some people prefer the NBA shooting numbers, mobile app downloading, and success elements of the chest game. Finally, after a discussion and carefully datasets searching, we decide to work on the Boston Airbnb dataset.
